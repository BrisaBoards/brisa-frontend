You can click and edit this as well.\n\nWhile editing, there are 2 buttons to the right to Save or Cancel editing. If you prefer to stick with the keyboard, you can also use the tab button to move to the save button, then press enter to save.\n\nThere is a close button in the upper right of the popup to close this card.

Primary Tools","tags":["Important"],"description":"Brisa has 3 main tools to help you organize:\n\n1. Labels and tags.\n  In the settings menu (3 dots in the upper right), there is a tab for Labels. These are common tags you want to be able to access and apply to cards quickly.\n2. Boards.\n  The plus button below this description has different kinds of boards that you can create to help organize an idea or task.\n  Kanban allows you to create groups (like Todo, Started, Testing, Done) and add new cards or move them between groups as you progress.\n  Whiteboard allows you to arrange cards in a free-form way, to give a nice overview of tasks.\n  Sheet creates a spreadsheet-like interface to organize a list of items. (See #3 below for extending sheets)\n3. Models.\n  Models allow you to add fields to cards. In the settings menu, there is a section for creating models and adding fields to them. These can be helpful for cards in general, but they are especially useful for Sheets, allowing you to expand the fields available to edit.","metadata":{},"user_id":1}},{"data":{"id":3,"title":"3. Important Whiteboard","tags":["Important"],"description":"Click the icon on the right to open your whiteboard view. In the whiteboard view, you can click (or touch) and drag cards to organize in a more free-flow way.\n\nWhen you are adding a new board, the default tag is the title plus the board type. For example, if you had a card titled \"Family Vacation\" and added a sheet to it, the tag would be \"Family Vacation Sheet\".\nWith this whiteboard, the default tag was changed to \"Important\", so any card you create in the Important label on the dashboard will show up in this whiteboard.","metadata":{"_whiteboard":{"classes":null,"tags":["Important"],"positions":{"1":{"x":"20px","y":"0px"},"2":{"x":"20px","y":"190px"},"4":{"x":"620px","y":"0px"}}},"style":{"color":"0,0,0","opacity":"0.0","paper":"","grid":"10","card_bg":""}},"user_id":1,"classes":["_whiteboard"]}},{"data":{"id":4,"title":"4.

It allows you to add items to it and sort them however you want by dragging and dropping them.\n\nIt also shows 2 other things:\n1. Models: These are not normal spredsheets. They are extended with Models that allow you to add additional fields beyond the Title and Description.\n2. Boards: Any card can have another board added to it.
